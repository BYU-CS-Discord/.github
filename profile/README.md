We develop software for the BYU CS Discord server. An invite link is shown on the organization's profile.

Our main project is [CSBot](https://github.com/BYU-CS-Discord/CSBot), the "official" (or as official one can get) replacement to [ArkenStorm](https://github.com/ArkenStorm)'s [Ze-Kaiser](https://github.com/ArkenStorm/Ze-Kaiser), which has served us for many years.

We also have a [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/BYU-CS-Discord) org, which hosts a [mirror of CSBot](https://codeberg.org/BYU-CS-Discord/CSBot).
